I have priority update information. 
The primary source of medical help is provided by hospitals. 
Residents in the surrounding area of Pulma depend on the hospital located in Pulma.
Pulma's Hospital storage has collapsed in the earthquake resulting in a severe shortage of medical supplies.
According to my mission updates, we should go to the hospital first because of the hospital damage reported.  So, the bridge should be given lower priority.  
#
The bridge between Silta and Pulma, over Matala River, has collapsed. Therefore, it cannot be crossed.
#
I want to go to the bridge because out of all of my supplies I have the most construction. 
I have 40 Food, 25 Water, 5 Medical Supplies, and 60 Construction supplies.
#
Hospital needs 50 units of cleaning supplies.
The bridge requires 5 tons of gravel.
#
I have capacity information that says Truck 1 can carry 90 units, Truck 2 can carry 130 units, Truck 3 can carry 100 units and Truck 4 can carry 105 units.
#
Truck 1 can transport 2 people.
Truck 3 has refrigeration capability.
Truck 2 and 3 need maintenance check after 2000 miles.
#
I think we should go with Route 3 because it is the shortest distance.
#
Due to landslides, travel time for Route 3 has increased by 200 minutes.
Severe Storm Warning: Nandor Highway 12 Satula to Armas.
Accident on Nandor Highway 12, expect a 2 hour delay.
