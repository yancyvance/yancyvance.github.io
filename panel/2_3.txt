I have priority update information.  
The distribution center is asking for water donations. 
The shelter is rapidly running out of water and food supplies due to the increase of those in need.
City of Pulma now relies heavily on the distribution center for their water needs.
According to my mission debrief document, the distribution center is supporting the shelter. So I think the distribution center should be a higher priority than the shelter to better support it.  Next, we should decide which destination should be the first.
#
Hospital is getting additional support from the Army and does not require immediate attention. 
Damaged hospital wing has been repaired.
Shelter's intake center is located in the parking lot.
#
I have almost the same amount of Food, Water and Medical Supplies so I want to go to the Hospital.
I have 25 Food, 25 Water, 30 Medical Supplies, and 10 Construction supplies. 
#
There may not be enough supplies to meet the requirements of all the destinations.
The Shelter needs 100 blankets.
The Shelter needs 1000 rolls of toilet paper.
#
I have capacity information that says Truck 1 can carry 85 units, Truck 2 can carry 120 units, Truck 3 can carry 125 units and Truck 4 can carry 115 units.
#
Truck 1 cannot transport more than 1000 gallons of fuel.
Truck 5 has a capacity of 125. 
Truck 2 will carry 10 units of industrial equipment thus only 110 will be available to use.
#
I think we should go with Route 4 because the bridge got repaired last time.
#
The road between Silta and Pulma has been destroyed due to aftershocks and is untraversable and therefore, the bridge between Silta and Pulma is inaccessible.
Nandor Highway 12 between Satula to Loe is clear for travel. 
Alert: Doctors Without Borders are on route to Kapea.
